Zunify
======

A tool to parse Zune playlists (.zpl) and export them to a more human-readable format.

At the moment, this just saves everything (in order) in the "ARTIST NAME - TRACK TITLE" format. That's just so I could test it out with [Ivy](http://www.ivyishere.org).

Implementation is pretty primitive for the moment, but it does work. At least, it seems to ;)
